# Code Review

Code review written by [Simon LÃ¶vbacka](https://github.com/lovbackan).

1. `info.php:31-32` - You dont need the (=== true) in the if statement since it already is a boolean.

2. `info.php:15` - I dont think the (size="48px") has any function and even if it had u probably dont want to have inline css in ur html code.

3. `info.php:43-48` - I think it would be good practice to make this forloop inside a function in functions.php, where u can put a number in the function and it would echo that amount of trees and then just call the function in this line. Then u could reuse this function everytime u would need the pretty tree emoji.

4. `main.css: 55-56 -I dont think u need the .flex-container-2 since it has the same values as .flex-container.

5. `header.php: 12 ` - The title of ur loveley site should probably not be named document.
